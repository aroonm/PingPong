PingPong
========

Simple Ping Pong game application coded using Java

I created this small game application as a first semester project in college for my 
'Computer Programming and Problem Solving Course'.

To run this application, download the three classes and run the one named, 'Pong'.

To play this game, control the paddle using your mouse. Every time you make contact with the ball you get a point.
The speed of the ball increases as the game progresses, so watch out for that.
